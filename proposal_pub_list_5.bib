ABSTRACT = {In early 2017 high particulate matter (PM) levels were observed across mid-Europe, including Austria. Here we characterize PM pollution in the city of Graz during January to March 2017, a period with substantial exceedances (34 days) of the European Union (EU) PM10 short time limit value. This study evaluates whether the observed exceedances can be attributed to the accumulation of pollutants emitted by local sources or to a larger scale pollution episode including transport. The analyses are based on the ratios of PM10 concentrations determined at an urban and background site, and the analyses of chemical composition of PM2.5 samples (i.e., water soluble ions, organic and elemental carbon, anhydro-sugars, humic-like substances, aluminum, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Source apportionment was realized using a macro-tracer model. Overall, the combination of different approaches (PM10 ratios, chemical composition, and macro-tracer derived source apportionment) enabled a conclusive identification of time periods characterized by the accumulation of emissions from local sources or regional pollution episodes.},

Abstract = {{Future air quality will be driven by changes in air pollutant emissions,
   but also changes in climate. Here, we review the recent literature on
   future air quality scenarios and projected changes in effects on human
   health, crops and ecosystems. While there is overlap in the scenarios
   and models used for future projections of air quality and climate
   effects on human health and crops, similar efforts have not been widely
   conducted for ecosystems. Few studies have conducted joint assessments
   across more than one sector. Improvements in future air quality effects
   on human health are seen in emission reduction scenarios that are more
   ambitious than current legislation. Larger impacts result from changing
   particulate matter (PM) abundances than ozone burdens. Future global
   health burdens are dominated by changes in the Asian region. Expected
   future reductions in ozone outside of Asia will allow for increased crop
   production. Reductions in PM, although associated with much higher
   uncertainty, could offset some of this benefit. The responses of
   ecosystems to air pollution and climate change are long-term, complex,
   and interactive, and vary widely across biomes and over space and time.
   Air quality and climate policy should be linked or at least considered
   holistically, and managed as a multi-media problem. This article is part
   of a discussion meeting issue `Air quality, past present and future'.}},

Abstract = {{While capabilities in urban climate modeling have substantially
   increased in recent decades, the interdependency of changes in
   environmental surface properties and human (dis)comfort have only
   recently received attention. The open-source solar long-wave
   environmental irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) model is one of the
   state-of-the-art models frequently used for urban (micro-)climatic
   studies. Here, we present updated calculation schemes for SOLWEIG
   allowing the improved prediction of surface temperatures (wall and
   ground). We illustrate that parameterizations based on measurements of
   global radiation on a south-facing vertical plane obtain better results
   compared to those based on solar elevation. Due to the limited number of
   ground surface temperature parameterizations in SOLWEIG, we implement
   the two-layer force-restore method for calculating ground temperature
   for various soil conditions. To characterize changes in urban canyon air
   temperature (T-can), we couple the calculation method as used in the
   Town Energy Balance (TEB) model. Comparison of model results and
   observations (obtained during field campaigns) indicates a good
   agreement between modeled and measured T-can, with an explained variance
   of R-2 =0.99. Finally, we implement an energy balance model for
   vertically mounted PV modules to contrast different urban surface
   properties. Specifically, we consider (i) an environment comprising dark
   asphalt and a glass facade and (ii) an environment comprising bright
   concrete and a PV facade. The model results show a substantially
   decreased T-can (by up to - 1.65 degrees C) for the latter case,
   indicating the potential of partially reducing/mitigating urban heat
   island effects.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate terrain effects on short-wave radiation measurements at
   Kanzelhohe Observatory (KSO), a mountainous radiation monitoring site in
   the Austrian Southern Alps, using three-dimensional (3-D) radiative
   transfer (RT) modeling and observations. The magnitude of terrain
   effects on global radiation is experimentally assessed through the
   comparison of 10-min measurement segments ex - /including terrain
   reflected radiation. The reflected component is ex - /included in global
   solar irradiance (GLO) measurements through a horizon shaped metal frame
   raised/lowered in 10-min intervals. Additionally we assess terrain
   influence in 3-D RT model simulations performed with an updated version
   of GRIMALDI, allowing for digital elevation model inclusion. The DEM
   used for terrain representation is the one arc second Shuttle Radar
   Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model. For GRIMALDI
   simulations we consider an area averaged albedo of 0.30 for summer and
   0.36 for winter (0.30 for forests and 0.90 for fresh snow),
   respectively. The influence of the horizon and surface albedo on a grid
   cell of interest (KSO location) is derived through comparison of the
   solar irradiance incident on a domain grid cell surface (SI-GCS) with
   SI-GCS reduced for the reflected component. Applying a 2a threshold for
   the significance of terrain effects in GLO measurements, we find no
   significant influence of the surrounding during summertime. Also during
   wintertime, we find for the vast majority of observational increments no
   significant influence of the surrounding. Above a 2a threshold,
   exceedances are small, on average 0.2 W m(-2) Differences between 3-D RT
   model simulations including and excluding terrain effects are small
   during winter conditions, i.e. always below 1\% and never exceeding 1 W
   m(-2). Slightly larger differences are found for 3-D RT simulations
   including/excluding the reflected component during summertime, reaching
   at solar noon up to 6.1 W m(-2). Both observations and model simulations
   indicate that KSO is well suited for radiation monitoring as terrain
   effects are small (close to negligible considering instrument
   specifications) throughout the year.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Considering the representation of the atmosphere, the current generation
   of Earth-System Models (ESMs) differs mainly in the representation of
   the stratospheric ozone layer and its variability and changes. So-called
   high-top models have a well resolved stratosphere and typically
   calculate ozone chemistry interactively, low-top models on the other
   hand rely on parameterized ozone chemistry or prescribed climatological
   ozone fields and have a model top below the stratopause. Here we
   investigate whether interactive ozone chemistry is important for
   representing temperature variability and extremes in the Arctic polar
   stratosphere. To this end we analyze a suite of two 200 year sensitivity
   simulations, one with interactive ozone chemistry and one without,
   performed with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 4
   (WACCM4), a stratosphere-resolving version of the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research Community Earth-System Model. We find a tight
   coupling between ozone and temperatures over the Arctic polar cap,
   manifesting in increased variability in stratospheric spring-time
   temperatures in simulations with interactive chemistry compared to
   simulations imposing climatological mean ozone abundances. Our results
   indicate that stratospheric temperature extremes regularly occurring in
   simulations with interactive chemistry are absent in uncoupled model

Abstract = {{While compliance with air quality standards is evaluated at individual
   monitoring stations, projections of future ambient air quality for
   global climate and emission scenarios often rely on coarse resolution
   models. We describe a statistical transfer approach that bridges the
   spatial gap between air quality projections, averaged over four broad
   U.S. regions, from a global chemistry-climate model and the local level
   (at specific U.S. CASTNet sites). Our site-level projections are
   intended as a line of evidence in planning for possible futures rather
   than the sole basis for policy decisions. We use a set of transient
   sensitivity simulations (2006-2100) from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory (GFDL) chemistry-climate model CM3, designed to isolate the
   effects of changes in anthropogenic ozone (O-3) precursor emissions,
   climate warming, and global background CH4 on surface O-3. We find that
   surface maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O-3 increases despite constant
   precursor emissions in a warmer climate during summer, particularly in
   the low tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution for the Northeastern U.S.,
   while MDA8 O-3 decreases slightly throughout the distribution over the
   West and Southeast during summer and fall. Under scenarios in which
   non-methane O-3 precursors decline as climate warms (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5),
   summertime MDA8 O-3 decreases with NOx emissions, most strongly in the
   upper tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution. In a scenario where global
   methane abundances roughly double over the 21st century (RCP8.5), winter
   and spring MDA8 O-3 increases, particularly in the lower tail and over
   the Western U.S. In this RCP8.5 scenario, the number of days when MDA8
   O-3 exceeds 70 ppb declines in summer with NOx emissions, but increases
   in spring (and winter); by the end of the century, the majority of sites
   in the WE and NE show probabilistic return values of the annual 4th
   highest MDA8 O-3 concentration above 70 ppb (the current O-3 NAAQS
   level). Continued increases in global CH4 abundances can be thought of
   as a ``methane penalty{''}, offsetting benefits otherwise attainable by
   controlling non-CH4 O-3 precursors.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, automated sensors for sunshine duration (SD)
   measurements have been introduced in meteorological networks, thereby
   replacing traditional instruments, most prominently the Campbell-Stokes
   (CS) sunshine recorder. Parallel records of automated and traditional SD
   recording systems are rare. Nevertheless, such records are important to
   understand the differences/similarities in SD totals obtained with
   different instruments and how changes in monitoring device type affect
   the homogeneity of SD records. This study investigates the
   differences/similarities in parallel SD records obtained with a CS and
   two automated SD sensors between 2007 and 2016 at the Kanzelhohe
   Observatory, Austria. Comparing individual records of daily SD totals,
   we find differences of both positive and negative sign, with smallest
   differences between the automated sensors. The larger differences
   between CS-derived SD totals and those from automated sensors can be
   attributed (largely) to the higher sensitivity threshold of the CS
   instrument. Correspondingly, the closest agreement among all sensors is
   found during summer, the time of year when sensitivity thresholds are
   least critical. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of various
   models to create the so-called sensor-type-equivalent (STE) SD records.
   Our analysis shows that regression models including all available data
   on daily (or monthly) time scale perform better than simple three- (or
   four-) point regression models. Despite general good performance, none
   of the considered regression models (of linear or quadratic form)
   emerges as the ``optimal{''} model. Although STEs prove useful for
   relating SD records of individual sensors on daily/monthly time scales,
   this does not ensure that STE (or joint) records can be used for trend
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of low ozone episodes on UV-B
   radiation in Austria during the period 1999 to 2015. To this aim
   observations of total column ozone (TCO) in the Greater Alpine Region
   (Arosa, Switzerland; Hohenpeissenberg, Germany; Hradec Kralove, Czech
   Republic; Sonnblick, Austria), and erythemal UV-B radiation, available
   from 12 sites of the Austrian UV-B monitoring network, are analyzed. As
   previous definitions for low ozone episodes are not particularly suited
   to investigate effects on UV radiation, a novel threshold
   approach-considering anomalies-is developed to provide a joint framework
   for the analysis of extremes. TCO and UV extremes are negatively
   correlated, although modulating effects of sunshine duration impact the
   robustness of the statistical relationship. Therefore, information on
   relative sunshine duration (SDrel), available at (or nearby) UV-B
   monitoring sites, is included as explanatory variable in the analysis.
   The joint analysis of anomalies of both UV index (UVI) and total ozone
   (Delta UVI, Delta TCO) and SDrel across sites shows that more than 65\%
   of observations with strongly negative ozone anomalies (Delta TCO < -1)
   led to positive UVI anomalies. Considering only days with strongly
   positive UVI anomaly (Delta UVI > 1), we find (across all sites) that
   about 90\% correspond to negative Delta TCO. The remaining 10\% of days
   occurred during fair weather conditions (SDrel >= 80\%) explaining the
   appearance of Delta UVI > 1 despite positive TCO anomalies. Further, we
   introduce an anomaly amplification factor (AAF), which quantifies the
   expected change of the Delta UVI for a given change in Delta TCO.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) is to
   provide the research community with an up-to-date scientific assessment
   of tropospheric ozone, from the surface to the tropopause. While a suite
   of observations provides significant information on the spatial and
   temporal distribution of tropospheric ozone, observational gaps make it
   necessary to use global atmospheric chemistry models to synthesize our
   understanding of the processes and variables that control tropospheric
   ozone abundance and its variability. Models facilitate the
   interpretation of the observations and allow us to make projections of
   future tropospheric ozone and trace gas distributions for different
   anthropogenic or natural perturbations. This paper assesses the skill of
   current-generation global atmospheric chemistry models in simulating the
   observed present-day tropospheric ozone distribution, variability, and
   trends. Drawing upon the results of recent international multi-model
   intercomparisons and using a range of model evaluation techniques, we
   demonstrate that global chemistry models are broadly skillful in
   capturing the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric ozone over the
   seasonal cycle, for extreme pollution episodes, and changes over
   interannual to decadal periods. However, models are consistently biased
   high in the northern hemisphere and biased low in the southern
   hemisphere, throughout the depth of the troposphere, and are unable to
   replicate particular metrics that define the longer term trends in
   tropospheric ozone as derived from some background sites. When the
   models compare unfavorably against observations, we discuss the
   potential causes of model biases and propose directions for future
   developments, including improved evaluations that may be able to better
   diagnose the root cause of the model-observation disparity. Overall,
   model results should be approached critically, including determining
   whether the model performance is acceptable for the problem being
   addressed, whether biases can be tolerated or corrected, whether the
   model is appropriately constituted, and whether there is a way to
   satisfactorily quantify the uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Winter storms pose numerous hazards to the Northeast United States,
   including rain, snow, strong wind, and flooding. These hazards can cause
   millions of dollars in damages from one storm alone. This study
   investigates meteorological intensity and impacts of winter storms from
   2001 to 2014 on coastal counties in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New
   York and underscores the consequences of winter storms. The study
   selected 70 winter storms on the basis of station observations of
   surface wind strength, heavy precipitation, high storm tide, and snow
   extremes. Storm rankings differed between measures, suggesting that
   intensity is not easily defined with a single metric. Several storms
   fell into two or more categories (multiple-category storms). Following
   storm selection, property damages were examined to determine which types
   lead to high losses. The analysis of hazards (or events) and associated
   damages using the Storm Events Database of the National Centers for
   Environmental Information indicates that multiple-category storms were
   responsible for a greater portion of the damage. Flooding was
   responsible for the highest losses, but no discernible connection exists
   between the number of storms that afflict a county and the damage it
   faces. These results imply that losses may rely more on the incidence of
   specific hazards, infrastructure types, and property values, which vary
   throughout the region.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of solar radiation measurements, for direct (DIR) and
   diffuse (DIF) radiation, depends significantly on the precision of the
   operational Sun-tracking device. Thus, rigid targets for instrument
   performance and operation have been specified for international
   monitoring networks, e. g., the Baseline Surface Radiation Network
   (BSRN) operating under the auspices of the World Climate Research
   Program (WCRP). Sun-tracking devices that fulfill these accuracy
   requirements are available from various instrument manufacturers;
   however, none of the commercially available systems comprise an
   automatic accuracy control system allowing platform operators to
   independently validate the pointing accuracy of Sun-tracking sensors
   during operation. Here we present KSO-STREAMS (KSO-SunTRackEr Accuracy
   Monitoring System), a fully automated, system-independent, and
   cost-effective system for evaluating the pointing accuracy of
   Sun-tracking devices. We detail the monitoring system setup, its design
   and specifications, and the results from its application to the
   Sun-tracking system operated at the Kanzelohe Observatory (KSO) Austrian
   radiation monitoring network (ARAD) site. The results from an evaluation
   campaign from March to June 2015 show that the tracking accuracy of the
   device operated at KSO lies within BSRN specifications (i. e., 0.1
   degrees tracking accuracy) for the vast majority of observations (99.8
   \%). The evaluation of manufacturer-specified active-tracking accuracies
   (0.02 degrees), during periods with direct solar radiation exceeding
   300Wm(-2), shows that these are satisfied in 72.9\% of observations.
   Tracking accuracies are highest during clear-sky conditions and on days
   where prevailing clear-sky con-ditions are interrupted by frontal
   movement; in these cases, we obtain the complete fulfillment of BSRN
   requirements and 76.4\% of observations within manufacturer-specified
   active-tracking accuracies. Limitations to tracking surveil-lance arise
   during overcast conditions and periods of partial solar-limb coverage by
   clouds. On days with variable cloud cover, 78.1\% (99.9 \%) of
   observations meet active-tracking (BSRN) accuracy requirements while for
   days with pre-vailing overcast conditions these numbers reduce to 64.3\%
   (99.5 \%).}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of ambient meteorology on the
   accuracy of radiation (R) measurements performed with pyranometers
   contained in various heating and ventilation systems (HV-systems). It
   focuses particularly on instrument offsets observed following
   precipitation events. To quantify pyranometer responses to
   precipitation, a series of controlled laboratory experiments as well as
   two targeted field campaigns were performed in 2016. The results
   indicate that precipitation (as simulated by spray tests or observed
   under ambient conditions) significantly affects the thermal environment
   of the instruments and thus their stability. Statistical analyses of
   laboratory experiments showed that precipitation triggers zero offsets
   of -4Wm(-2) or more, independent of the HV-system. Similar offsets were
   observed in field experiments under ambient environmental conditions,
   indicating a clear exceedance of BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation
   Network) targets following precipitation events. All pyranometers
   required substantial time to return to their initial signal states after
   the simulated precipitation events. Therefore, for BSRN-class
   measurements, the recommendation would be to flag the radiation
   measurements during a natural precipitation event and 90 min after it in
   nighttime conditions. Further daytime experiments show pyranometer
   offsets of 50Wm(-2) or more in comparison to the reference system. As
   they show a substantially faster recovery, the recommendation would be
   to flag the radiation measurements within a natural precipitation event
   and 10 min after it in daytime conditions.}},
