The applicant will collaborate within the \gls{odina} project also closely with core developers of \gls{cesm} at the \gls{ncar/ucar} in Boulder, \acrshort{col}, \acrshort{usa}. Tasks in \gls{wp}~2 (see Chapter~\ref{c:project_plan}) will be partially performed during a research stay at \gls{ncar/ucar} hosted by Dr.~Louisa Emmons (Atmospheric Chemistry Observations \& Modeling Lab) and Dr.~Dave Lawrence (Climate \& Global Dynamics Lab) and their teams, see letter of collaboration in \hyperref[fig:loi_ncar]{Annex~5}. 
In particular, the applicant will benefit from technical support by the core developers of the \gls{cesm} concerning the code integration and coupling of atmospheric \ch{[O_3]} to \gls{odina} described in \glspl{wp}~1--2 (Section~\ref{sec:wp1}--\ref{sec:wp2}). Furthermore, the offered guidance by the \gls{ncar/ucar} community, in particular by the land-modeling and atmospheric groups during the planed research stay, will foster valuable connections and experience for future career perspectives.
The \gls{odina} project will benefit from the established contacts with \gls{ncar/ucar} also in the later phase \glspl{wp}~3--4 (Section~\ref{sec:wp3}--\ref{sec:wp4}) with respect to analysis and assessment of the modeling results. Both sides are expected to benefit from the contributions by the applicant and \gls{boku} to future development of the \gls{cesm}.

Additional collaboration will include the technical and scientific staff at the \gls{uio} (Norway), particularly Prof. Terje K. Berntsen (Section for Meteorology and Oceanography) and the \gls{clm} Norway team (see letter of collaboration in \hyperref[fig:loi_uio]{Annex~5}). 
The mountainous landscapes of both Austria and Norway pose similar challenges for \gls{esm} modeling, wherefore both sides will benefit from continuing existing collaborations within the \gls{emerald} project during \gls{odina}. The future involvement of the applicant and \gls{boku} in \gls{cesm} development will also benefit its sister~model the \gls{noresm}, and thereby modeling initiatives of the Norwegian partners.
Furthermore, it is planned to utilize the potential of the land-modelling platform developed at \gls{uio} in collaboration with the applicant during her stay for the purpose of site-level model evaluation in \gls{wp}3 (Section~\ref{sec:wp3}).
